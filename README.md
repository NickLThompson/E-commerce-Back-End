## Description

This program is designed to navigate through a database and create, 

delete, or update and products, their tags, and their categories.

This is done through insomnia, which will be shown in the video.

You can view all, view 1, create, update, and delete any of one the 

3 (products, tags, and categories)

## Usage

The usage of this program is designed to navigate and go through a

database very efficiently while still being able to keep track and view

all changes made. If you happen to add something and need it removed, you

simply run the delete; If you find that something needs updated, simply

run the update method.

## Status

The status of this program is a good success. I found this to be relatively

simple, but simplicity is not synonymous with easy. I was really happy to

have completed it, especially in a timely manner. I find that backend things

are significantly more tedious and specific, but go with my workflow very well.

Frontend development just didn't jell with me as much as this does. I'm

satisfied with the outcome and I'm excited to see what's next.
